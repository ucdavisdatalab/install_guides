# Overview {-}

These guides will walk you through installing some of the most common data science tools used at the UC Davis DataLab and beyond. Use the sidebar on the left to navigate to the category of programs you would like to install. If you are taking a class or workshop using these tools, please install them prior to attending. The workshop information should tell you what software you need.
