## Git

### Introduction

Git is a ubiquitous software for *version control*. Version control describes a 
process of storing and organizing multiple versions (or copies) of documents that 
you create. Approaches to version control range from simple to complex and can 
involve the use of various human workflows and/or software applications to 
accomplish the overall goal of storing and managing multiple versions of the 
same document(s).  

Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that looks 
something like this:

![](`r git_url` "File explorer showing several copies of a word document with version tags")

Or perhaps, this:

![](`r git_url2` "File explorer showing several copies of a word document with dates")

This is a rudimentary form of version control that relies completely on the 
human workflow of saving multiple versions of a file. This system works minimally 
well, in that it does provide you with a history of file versions theoretically 
organized by their time sequence. But this filesystem method provides no information 
about how the file has changed from version to version, why you might have saved 
a particular version, or specifically how the various versions are related. This 
human-managed filesystem approach is more subject to error than software-assisted 
version control systems. It is not uncommon for users to make mistakes when naming 
file versions, or to go back and edit files out of sequence. Software-assisted 
version control systems such as Git were designed to solve this problem.

If you would like more information on how Git works, read more in the 
[Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
for free.

### Git on Windows

Follow these step-by-step instructions if you're installing Git on a Windows 
machine:

First, launch a web browser, the image below shows the Microsoft Edge browser:

![](`r git_url19` "New web browser window") 

Next, navigate to the following Git download URL in your browser 
[https://git-scm/com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}:

![](`r git_url20` "git website") 

Select "Windows" from the Downloads portion of the Git webpage. Git will display 
the following page and automatically being downloading the correct version of the 
Git software. If the download doesn't start automatically, click on the "Click here 
to download manually link":

![](`r git_url21` "git download page") 

When the download is complete, open/Run the downloaded file (will look different 
in different browsers, but everyone should know how to do this):

![](`r git_url22` "Completed download box") 

A screen will appear asking for permissions for the Git application to make changes 
to your device. Click on the **Yes** button:

![](`r git_url23` "Windows request to allow program to alter files") 

Click **Next** to accept the user license:

![](`r git_url24` "git license agreement") 

Leave the default "Destination Location" unchanged (usually C:\\Program Files\\Git) 
and hit **Next**

![](`r git_url25` "git location selection")

You will see a screen like the one below asking you to "Select Components":

![](`r git_url26` "git component selection")

Leave all of the default components selected and also check the boxes next to 
"Additional Icons" and it's sub-item, "On the Desktop". Your completed 
configurations window should have the following components selected:

```
Additional Icons 
	-> On the Desktop
Windows Explorer integration
	-> Git Bash Here
	-> Git GUI Here
Git LFS (Large File Support)
Associate .git* configuration files with default text editor
Associate .sh files to be run with Bash
```

And should look like this:

![](`r git_url27` "git component selection with custom options")

After verifying that you have the necessary components selected as per above, 
hit **Next**.

The next screen will ask you to "Select a Start Menu Folder." Keep the default 
value of Git and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url28` "git start menu shortcut")

Leave the default "Use Vim (the ubiquitous text editor) as Git's default editor" 
selected on the "Choosing the default editor used by Git" screen and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url29` "git editor selection")

On the next screen, leave the default "let Git decide" option selected and hit 
**Next**:

![](`r git_url30` "git initial branch name selection")

Leave the default "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" 
selected and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url31` "git PATH options")

On the next "Choosing HTTPS transport backend" page leave the default "Use the 
OpenSSL library" option selected and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url32` "git HTTPS options")

Leave the default "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" 
selected on the next page and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url33` "git line end options")

Keep the default "Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MSYS2)" selected on the 
"Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash" window and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url34` "git bash options")

Keep the default value of "Default (fast-forward or merge)" on the "Choose the 
default behavior of 'git pull'" page and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url35` "git pull options")

Keep the default value of "Git Credential Manager Core" on the "Choose a credential 
helper" page and hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url36` "git credential options")

Keep the default values on the "Configuration extra options" page by keeping 
"Enable file system caching" checked and "Enable symbolic links" unchecked and 
then hit **Next**:

![](`r git_url37` "git extra options")

Make sure that no options are checked in the "Configuring experimental options" 
page and hit **Install**:

![](`r git_url38` "git experimental options")

After you hit this **Install** button as per above, you will see an install 
progress screen like the one below:

![](`r git_url39` "git installing")

When the install is complete, a new, "Completing the Git Setup Wizard" window 
like the one below will appear:

![](`r git_url40` "git completion window")

Make sure that all of the options on this window are unchecked as in the image 
below and then hit the **Finish** button:

![](`r git_url41` "git completion window with unchecked View Release Notes")

This will complete your installation process.

*Windows users should verify that when downloading Git for Windows they have also *
*installed Git Bash, which is necessary for working with Git in command line.*

### Git on Mac

If you are installing Git on a Mac, there is no extra configuration. Simply go the 
Git download page at 
[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
and choose the latest version for Mac, and run the installer package when it is 
finished downloading. If you get an “unknown developer” warning during the install 
process, follow the instructions at the beginning of the video at 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__kr-Ew5kbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__kr-Ew5kbE){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
to help you work through this problem.

### Verifying your install

**Whether you're installing on Windows or Mac, note that unlike most applications **
**that you've installed before, you will not find a "Git" application in your **
**programs or applications directory once the installation is complete.** As 
long as you don't get an explicit error message during the installation process, 
you can assume that the software was successfully installed. Git is a command-line 
application with which you interact using the command-line. If you're already 
familiar with using command line, you can verify your install by opening the 
terminal (for Windows that will be Git Bash in your programs menu) and type 
`git --version`. You should then see a response of your installed version 
(e.g., git version 2.12.2.windows.2, or git version 2.12.2.mac.2), and not the 
error "command not found."

### Installation troubleshooting

If you are not able to successfully install Git on your own, please attend 
DataLab's Virtual Office Hours. Click

## Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu)

### Introduction

Windows now has the ability to install a Linux operating system on your machine 
without the use of an emulator. This gives you a full-featured linux environment 
that can interact with your normal files.

### Check your windows version

First, please check the build version of Windows that you are using. This can be 
done by selecting the `Windows logo key + r` on your keyboard. Once you do that, 
you should see the windows Run prompt:

![](`r win_version_run` "Windows check version from run prompt")

Type the command "winver" (no quotes) into the prompt, as depicted in the image 
above, and hit enter. You should see a screen similar to this:

![](`r win_version_popup` "Windows build version")

Your build version number is the one that follows the "Windows Build" text (as 
highlighted in the above image). Depending on whether your build number is larger 
or smaller than 19041, please follow 
the appropriate directions below:

* [Larger than (or equal to) 19041][Windows version larger than (or equal to) 19041]
* [Smaller than 19041][Windows version larger smaller than 19041]

#### Windows version larger than (or equal to) 19041

In the start menu, search for "Powershell", right click and select "run as 
administrator".

![](`r win_search_powershell` "Windows search menu for PowerShell")

A small blue window should open with a flashing cursor. Please type `wsl --install` 
and hit enter:

![](`r win_wsl_powershell` "PowerShell command for installing WSL")

This will take a few minutes to install everything. Once it is finished, please 
skip to [verifying your install](#commandline-verify).

If the above installation did not work- please try to install 
[using these instructions][Windows version larger smaller than 19041] (even if 
your version is not smaller than 19041).

#### Windows version larger smaller than 19041

In the start menu, search for "Turn Windows features on or off" and open that 
settings window. 

![](`r wsl_1` "Windows search menu selecting Turn windows features on or off")

In the settings window, scroll down to "Windows Subsystem for Linux", check the 
box next to it, and select `OK` at the bottom of the window.

![](`r wsl_2` "Windows features window turning on Windows Subsystem for Linux")

You will not need to restart your computer. Once you have rebooted, open the 
Windows Store from the start menu.

![](`r wsl_3` "Windows search menu opening the Microsoft store")

In the Windows Store, search for `Ubuntu`, and select the version-less one 
unless you have a reason to pick a specific version.

![](`r wsl_4` "Home page of Microsoft store searching for Ubuntu")

On the Ubuntu page, select `Get` to install.

### Verifying your install {#commandline-verify}

In the start menu, search for and run `Ubuntu`.

![](`r wsl_5` "Windows search menu opening Ubuntu")

If a terminal window opens, you should be good to go!

![](`r wsl_6` "Ubuntu command line showing DataLab ascii art")

### Installation troubleshooting

If you are not able to successfully install the Linux Subsystem for Windows on 
your own, please attend DataLab's Virtual Office Hours. Click 
[here](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/office-hours/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}
