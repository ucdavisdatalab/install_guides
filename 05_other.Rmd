## OpenRefine

### Introduction

OpenRefine is an open source tool used to clean and pre-process messy data. While 
most people are familiar with data cleaning in their coding tool of choice (R, 
Python, Julia, etc.), OpenRefine is designed to provide powerful cleaning 
capabilities with minimal overhead. One of the most helpful capabilities of 
OpenRefine is the ability to check for possible duplicates and misspellings of
text data using its text facet tools.

### OpenRefine on Windows

Open your web browser of choice and navigate to the OpenRefine homepage at 
[https://openrefine.org/](https://openrefine.org/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}. 
Click on the download button in the left sidebar.

![](`r or_img01` "openrefine home page")

On the download page, scroll to the latest version of OpenRefine and select the 
**Windows kit**. If you are unsure if you have Java installed on your system, 
choose the **Windows kit with embedded Java** instead.

![](`r or_img02` "openrefine download page")

Once the download has completed, open the zip and move the contents to a 
convenient location on your computer.

![](`r or_img03` "7-zip archive with arrow dragging openrefine files to desktop")

Open the resulting directory, and double click on the **openrefine.exe** executable.

![](`r or_img04` "file browser highlighting openrefine executable")

The OpenRefine executable will start a terminal window, and shortly after launch 
a tab in your default web browser with the OpenRefine interface.
 
![](`r or_img05` "openrefine running in web browser")

### OpenRefine on Mac

If you are installing OpenRefine on a Mac, there is no extra configuration. Simply 
go the [download page for OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/download.html){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
and choose the latest version for mac. Run the installer package when it is finished 
downloading. If you receive an error regarding the app being from an unidentified 
developer, please 
[follow the instructions here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}.

### Verifying your install

To verify everything is working, first start OpenRefine. It will open a page in 
your browser of choice that resembles the following.

![](`r or_img06` "openrefine create project page")

Click the `Choose Files` button, and enter 
[this dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucdavisdatalab/research-toolkits/main/data/job_board_errors.csv){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
(you can just put in the URL). Click `Next`.

![](`r or_img07` "openrefine create project page with data file selected")

OpenRefine will load in the data and present you with a preview. The defaults 
should be fine. Click `Create Project` in the upper right hand corner.

![](`r or_img08` "openrefine data import page")

You will then be presented with the OpenRefine working area. Click the arrow next 
to the `What sector ...` column and select `Facet -> Text facet`.

![](`r or_img09` "openrefine data window showing imported data")

In the left hand menu, click the `Cluster` button.

![](`r or_img10` "openrefine data window showing imported data and facet menu")

In the following menu, for method select `nearest neighbor`. OpenRefine will look 
through that column for any strings that are similar, and show you. This can be 
helpful for finding typos. Here, we see there are two misspellings of "Academia". 
Click the Check-box in the `Merge?` column, then select `Merge Selected & Close`. 
OpenRefine will change all strings in the `Values in Cluster` column to match the 
`New Cell Value`. If that all worked, OpenRefine is working!

## Tesseract

### Introduction

[Tesseract](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
is Google's open source tool for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It is used 
to convert images of text into usable textual data. This can be a very difficult task 
for computers, and will often result in some amount of errors. Nevertheless, 
significant progress has been made in recent years, and it is a very useful tool 
to have. Tesseract is often called by other programming languages such as R or 
Python to perform OCR tasks.

### Tesseract on Windows

Tesseract is natively a Linux tool, but community maintained ports exist for Windows. 
We will be using the binaries prepared by the 
[Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim)](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
to install Tesseract today. First head to their 
[github page](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
and scroll down to "The latest installers can be downloaded here." Download the 
version that matches your machine (most likely 64 bit).

![](`r tes_1` "tesseract github repo")

Once the download has finished, launch the installer from your browser or downloads 
folder.

![](`r tes_2` "web browser showing finished tesseract download")

Once the installer has started, select your language and continue to the second 
page by pressing `Next >`. Accept the license agreement by pressing `I Agree`. On 
the following page, select if you would like to install Tesseract for everyone on 
the computer, or just yourself.

![](`r tes_3` "tesseract installer user selection")

On the following page you will choose what languages you want to be able to run 
OCR on. **If you plan to run OCR on anything other than American English, you must **
**select them here**. "Additional script data" works for handwriting, and "Additional 
language data" works for printed material. I recommend you just install everything 
unless space is an issue. It will increase the install size from ~300mb to ~900mb. 

![](`r tes_4` "tesseract component selection")

On the next page, select where you will be installing Tesseract.
**You should leave it as the default unless you have a very good reason not to **
**and know how to re-assign path variables on your machine**.

![](`r tes_5` "tesseract install location")

Continue on until the installer finishes.

### Verifying your install

To verify Tesseract was installed correctly, open your Windows menu and launch 
`Windows PowerShell`.

![](`r tes_6` "windows search menu selecting the Windows PowerShell")

In the resulting window, copy the following command and press enter: 
`& "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe" --help-extra`. If you see the 
help message, you are all set!

## Synthetic Data Vault

This section will provide you with basic guidance for using the Synthetic Data Vault 
(SDV) Python library for generating synthetic data to augment your already-existing 
datasets. 

### Overview

Synthetic data (or "simulated data", "imputed data") is data that has been 
generated from an existing dataset. It bears the same statistical properties of 
the original dataset but does not give insight into identifying the original data. 
Synthetic data can be used for building models, conducting research, and more. 
Both statistical simulation and computational derivation can be used to generate s
ynthetic data. 

### About SDV

SDV is an open source project that uses uses probabilistic graphical modeling 
and deep learning to create synthetic data based off of the given dataset. 

Unique hierarchical generative modeling and recursive sampling allows for 
different structures of data to be used and generated. 

SDV is a great tool to use to generate synthetic data when you don't have enough d
ata or if you need some data to test your models with. 

#### How does SDV work? 

SDV contains several models and methods for your use in generating synthetic data. 

#### Which model should I choose? 

If you are generating tabular data with many continuous or quantifiable features, 
it is reccomended that you use the GaussianCopula or the TVAE models. The CTGAN 
model has also performed well for tabular data when the original data is mostly 
categorical or nominal. 

If you are generating synthetic images, it is reccomended that you use the CTGAN 
or CopulaGAN models.

SDV is not limited to just generating tabular data or image data either. 
Information on how to generate timeseries data can be found in the SDV documentation.


### SDV Example: Generating COVID-19 Variants

#### Environment Set-up

Before installing SDV, it is reccomended that you have available other data science 
libraries that will faciliate your use of the tool. In this example, an Anaconda 
environment to host my Jupyter Notebook is used. To find out how you can also 
set-up your general data science environment, please see the 
[DataLab Install Guide Toolkit](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/install-guide/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}.

#### SDV Set-up

SDV can be installed via PyPi just like any other Python library served in a 
similar manner. 

#### Data
For this toolkit, we will be generating additional COVID-19 variants based off 
of the thousands that already exist as of 2022. We will be using 
[this dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DyF9PdMbFQgiValuHtxSls34gdaY5067/view?usp=sharing){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
located in Google Drive. 

#### Code 

> Tip: I like to import `warnings` when using SDV in Jupyter notebook so that I 
> can ignore any warnings that pop-up. Remember that SDV is an open source project 
> and it is actively being updated by community members.
>        import warnings
>       warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

First, import the libraries Pandas and the CopulaGAN model from SDV.

        import pandas as pd
        from sdv.tabular import CopulaGAN

I saved the aforementioned dataset as "variants.csv" in my local filesystem. I 
will use Pandas to read the data into the dataframe named  `data` and then see 
what that dataframe looks like.

        data = pd.read_csv("variants.csv")
        data.head(20)

![](`r sdv_1` "A sample of data from the variants dataset")

Next, create an instance of the model that you plan to use (CopulaGAN, in this 
example). After you create an instance of the model, you can fit the data to the 
model.

        model = CopulaGAN()
        model.fit(data)

Now that you have a fitted model, you can specify how much synthetic data you 
want to generate from the model fitted to your original data.

        new_data = model.sample(200)

Let's view some of the new data:

        new_data.head()

![](`r sdv_2` "New variants of COVID-19 that we generated")

Interesting! We were able to generate some "new" COVID-19 variants.

##### Evaluating our results

We can evaluate how similar our synthetic data is to the original data by using 
the evualtion framework that comes with SDV:

        from sdv.evaluation import evaluate

We will use statistical measures of efficacy including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
(`KSTest`) test to compare the distributions of continuous columns and the 
Chi-Squared (`CSTest`) test to compare the distributions of discrete columns. We 
can also use a detection metric such as `LogisticDetection` which evaluates how 
hard it is to distinguish the synthetic data from the real data by using a 
machine learning model.

        metrics = ['KSTest', 'CSTest', 'LogisticDetection']

> Tip: You can find other evaluation metrics in SDV's documentation 
> [here.](https://sdv.dev/SDV/user_guides/evaluation/single_table_metrics.html){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"}

Let's run the evaluation framework with the metrics we selected. This is done by 
using the `evaluate()` function we just imported with the newly generated data 
(`new_data`) and the original data (`data`). We also include the metrics that 
were defined above.

        evaluate(new_data, data, aggregate=False, metrics=metrics) 

> Tip: The evaluation framework can take quite a long time to run especially if 
> you have a large amount of data! You can reduce the runtime of the evaluation 
> framework by selecting only the evaluation metrics that you want to use. 
> Otherwise, get a coffee and relax while it runs! 

Here are our results from running the evaluation framework:

![](`r sdv_3` "Scores from running the evaluation framework")

Hey, these are some pretty good scores!
