## DBeaver (SQL Database Viewer)

### Introduction

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} is a free and open source tool to inspect and manipulate databases of nearly any type. It has versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This can offer a more intuitive method for people new to databases to interact with their data, and create code to query data for other uses. Note that DBeaver does not *create* a database, it only allows you to view and interact with one.

### DBeaver on Windows

## DB Browser

### Introduction

Once you have started the installer, press the `Next` button to continue.

On the following screen, you will be asked to select what components you want to install and where. You can safely keep the defaults and continue. Press `Install` on the following page.
