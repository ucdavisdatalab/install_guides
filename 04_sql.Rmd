## DBeaver (SQL Database Viewer)

### Introduction

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} is a 
free and open source tool to inspect and manipulate databases of nearly any type. 
It has versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This can offer a more intuitive 
method for people new to databases to interact with their data, and create code 
to query data for other uses. Note that DBeaver does not *create* a database, 
it only allows you to view and interact with one.

### DBeaver on Windows

First navigate to the 
[download page](https://dbeaver.io/download/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
on DBeaver's website. Scroll down and click on the installer link to download it.

![](`r db_1` "DBeaver download page")

After the install finishes, click on the executable to launch the installer.

![](`r db_2` "web drowser showing DBeaver downloading")

Once you select your language, the installer will prompt you to close all other 
applications, and hit next. On the following page, accept the license agreement 
by clicking `I Agree`.

![](`r db_3` "Dbeaver license agreement")

On the next page, select if you would like to install DBeaver for all users on 
your machine, or just you. In most cases it is fine to install for everyone.

![](`r db_4` "Dbeaver user selection")

Depending on your selection, the installer may need to re-start with administrator 
privileges. Enter your previous options again until you reach the "Choose 
Components" page. Once here, you can leave the default settings and click `Next`.

![](`r db_5` "Dbeaver component selection")

The next page will ask where you would like to install DBeaver. The default 
location should work for most people, click `Next` to continue. The same is the 
true of the next page regarding the start menu location, you can click `Install` 
to start the installation process.

## DB Browser

### Introduction

[DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} 
is an ultra lightweight viewer for SQLite databases. It is made to allow those 
familiar with spreadsheets to work more easily with the common SQLite format. 
However, that is all that it does; you cannot use it on other database types.

### DB Browser on Windows

First head to the [DB Browser download page](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/), and 
select the version that matches your system. On Windows this is most likely the 
64-bit standard installer.

download location.

On the next screen, accept the license agreement and press `Next`. The following 
page will ask you if you would like to place shortcuts anywhere. Desktop will 
place icons on your desktop, while Program Menu will add options to your right 
click menu. You can choose to have these if you wish, I will not. Press `Next` 
once you have decided.

![](`r dbb_4` "DB browser shortcut options")

On the following screen, you will be asked to select what components you want to 
install and where. You can safely keep the defaults and continue. Press `Install` 
on the following page.
